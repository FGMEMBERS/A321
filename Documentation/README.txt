FOR YOUR INFORMATION :

 - You might feel it difficult to fly the A320 because of it's quick reactions to elevators and also the fact that each engine provides only 142000 kg (30000 lbs)thrust to the 47500 kg Airplane! This aircraft used REAL values for it's FDM. But we guess you'll be used to it quick.

SPECIAL THANKS TO:
 - Liam Gathercole for his 767-300's amazing autopilot, sounds and modified airport operations used in the A321
 - Skyop for his A320-family's Lights and Cabin
 - Syd Adams, Justin Smithies, Karla and Isa√≠as V. Prestes for the 777-300's tyre-smoke and contrails

IMPORTANT : We've thought that these models will be merged with skyop's A320-series, but we've decided NOT to do that. You won't be getting THESE models from skyop's hangar. He is working on an A321 and that will come with the A320-series. For more info, contact skyop.
