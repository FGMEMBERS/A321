FOR YOUR INFORMATION :

 - You might feel it difficult to fly the A320 because of it's quick reactions to elevators and also the fact that each engine provides only 142000 kg (30000 lbs)thrust to the 47500 kg Airplane! This aircraft used REAL values for it's FDM. But we guess you'll be used to it quick.
